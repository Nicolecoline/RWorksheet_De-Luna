## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


#1. Create a data frame using the table below


#1A. Write the codes


  HouseholdData <- data.frame(
  Respond_1 = c(1:20),
  
  Sex = c("Female","Female","Male","Female","Female","Female","Female","Female","Female","Female","Male","Female","Fe   male","Female","Female","Female","Female","Female","Male","Female"),
  
  FatherOccupation = c("Farmer","Others","Others","Others","Farmer","Driver","Others","Farmer","Farmer","Farmer","Oth   ers","Driver","Farmer","Others","Others","Farmer","Others","Farmer","Driver","Farmer"),
  
  PersonAtHome = c(5,7,3,8,5,9,6,7,8,4,7,5,4,7,8,8,3,11,7,6),
  
  SiblingsAtSchool = c(6,4,4,1,2,1,5,3,1,2,3,2,5,5,2,1,2,5,3,2),
  
  TypesOfHouses = c("Wood","Semi-Concrete","Concrete","Wood","Wood","Concrete","Concrete","Wood","Semi-Concrete","Con   crete","Semi-Concrete","Concrete","Semi-Concrete","Semi-Concrete","Concrete","Concrete","Concrete","Concrete","Conc   rete","Semi-Concrete")
  
  )
  HouseholdData



#1b.  Describe the data. Get the structure or the summary of the data

  summary(HouseholdData)

#1c Is the mean number of siblings attending is 5?
  MeanNumSib <- mean(HouseholdData$SiblingsAtSchool)
  IsMean5 <- MeanNumSib == 5
  print(IsMean5)

# False

#1d. Extract the 1st two rows and then all the columns using the subsetting functions.Write the codes and its output.

  ftrac <- HouseholdData[1:2, ]
  print(ftrac)

#1e. Extract 3rd and 5th row with 2nd and 4th column. Write the codes and its result.

  selrowcol <- HouseholdData[c(3, 5), c(2, 4)]
  print(selrowcol)

#1f. Select the variable types of houses then store the vector that results as types_houses.Write the codes.

  types_houses <- HouseholdData$TypeOfHouses

#1g. Select only all Males respondent that their father occupation was farmer. Write thecodes and its output.

  MaleFarmers <- HouseholdData[HouseholdData$Sex =="Male" & HouseholdData$FatherOccupation == "Farmer", ]
  print(MaleFarmers)

#1h. Select only all females respondent that have greater than or equal to 5 number ofsiblings attending school. Write the codes and its outputs.

  FemGT5Sib <- HouseholdData[HouseholdData$Sex == "Female" & HouseholdData$SiblingsAtSchool >= 5, ]
  print(FemGT5Sib)

#2 Write a R program to create an empty data frame. Using the following codes:

  df = data.frame(Ints=integer(),
                Doubles=double(), Characters=character(),
                Logicals=logical(),
                Factors=factor(),
                stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

  print("Structure of the empty dataframe:")
  print(str(df))

#2a. The data frame is empty

#3
  HouseholdData <- data.frame(
  Respondents = c(1:10),
  Sex = c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Female", "Male"),
  FathersOccupation = c(1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3),
  PersonAtHome = c(5, 7, 3, 8, 6, 4, 4, 2, 11, 6),
  SiblingsAtSchool = c(2, 3, 0, 5, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 2),
  TypesOfHouse = c("Wood", "Congrete", "Congrete", "Wood", "Semi-Congrete", "Semi-Congrete", "Wood", "Semi-Congrete",     "Semi-Congrete", "Congrete")
  )
  HouseholdData

#3a.Import the csv file into the R environment. Write the codes.

  write.csv(HouseholdData, file = "HouseholdData.csv", row.names = FALSE)
  ImporteData <- read.csv("HouseholdData.csv")


#3b.. Convert the Sex into factor using factor() function and change it into integer.[Legend:Male = 1 and Female = 2]. Write the R codes and its output.

  ImporteData$Sex <- factor(ImporteData$Sex, levels = c("Male", "Female"))
  ImporteData$Sex <- as.integer(ImporteData$Sex)

#3c.Convert the Type of Houses into factor and change it into integer. [Legend: Wood= 1; Congrete = 2; Semi-Congrete = 3]. Write the R codes and its output.
  ImporteData$TypesOfHouse <- factor(ImporteData$TypesOfHouse, levels = c("Wood", "Concrete", "Semi-Concrete"))
  ImporteData$TypesOfHouse <- as.integer(ImporteData$TypesOfHouse)


  ImporteData$TypesOfHouse <- factor(ImporteData$TypesOfHouse, levels = c("Wood", "Concrete", "Semi-Concrete"))
  ImporteData$TypesOfHouse <- as.integer(ImporteData$TypesOfHouse)

#3d.On fatherâ€™s occupation, factor it as Farmer = 1; Driver = 2; and Others = 3. Whatis the R code and its output?

  ImporteData$FathersOccupation <- factor(ImporteData$FathersOccupation, levels = c("Farmer", "Driver", "Others"))
  ImporteData$FathersOccupation <- as.integer(ImporteData$FathersOccupation)

#3e.Select only all females respondent that has a father whose occupation is driver. Writethe codes and its output.
  FemaleDrivers <- ImporteData[ImporteData$Sex == 2 & ImporteData$FathersOccupation == 2, ]
  print(FemaleDrivers)

#3f.Select the respondents that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attendingschool. Write the codes and its output.
  GT5Sib <- ImporteData[ImporteData$SiblingsAtSchool >= 5, ]
  print(GT5Sib)

#4. Interpret the graph

# The graph in figure 3 represents the sentiments of people every day that has a major impact on our world everytime. In short, we always allow ourselves to show our opinions and our knowledge that we learn in a all day basis.
