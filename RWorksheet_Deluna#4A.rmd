## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


#1 The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame
shoeSize_height_data <- data.frame(
  shoe_Size = c(6.5 ,9.0 ,8.5 ,8.5 ,10.5 ,7.0 ,9.5 ,9.0 ,13.0 ,7.5 ,10.5 ,8.5 ,12.0 ,10.5 ,13.0 ,11.58 ,8.4 ,5.0 ,10.0 ,6.5 ,7.5 ,8.5 ,10.5 ,8.5 ,10.5 ,11.0 ,9.0 ,13.0),
 
  height = c(66.0, 68.0 ,64.5 ,65.0 ,70.0 ,64.0 ,70.0 ,71.0 ,72.0 ,64.0 ,74.5 ,67.0 ,71.0 ,71.0 ,77.0 ,72.0, 59.0 ,62.0 ,72.0 ,66.0 ,64.0 ,67.0 ,73.0 ,69.0 ,72.0 ,70.0 ,69.0 ,70.0),

#a. Describe the data
  summary(shoeSize_height_data)
 
#b Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.What its result? Show the R scripts.
#c Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result

  mean_shoeSize <- mean(shoeSize_height_data$shoe_Size)
  mean_height <- mean(shoeSize_height_data$height)
 
  cat(mean_shoeSize)
  cat(mean_height)

#d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
# yes, because shoe size generally is proportional to height

#Factors

Gender <- c("M","F","F","M")

#2 Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.  

Months <- c("March","April","January","November","January",
"September","October","September","November","August",
"January","November","November","February","May","August",
"July","December","August","August","September","November","February","April")
factor_Months <- factor(Months)
